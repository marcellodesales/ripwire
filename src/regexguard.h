#pragma once

// regexguard.h — THE owner of user-authored regular expressions: the structural screen, the compile, and the
// match. Every pattern a user writes — `--regex`, `--graph-query file()`, an `--arch` path-rule, a `#match?` /
// `#not-match?` predicate in `--match` or `--lint-rules` — is compiled by compileGuardedRegex and matched
// through a GuardedRegex. No other file in src/ spells std::regex (test/regexguardcheck.sh arm (c)).
//
// WHY A SEAM. The screen used to live in src/search.h beside `--regex`, the one entry point that called it. The
// other three handed a user's pattern straight to the standard library, and a regex_error thrown there had no
// handler:
//
//     ripwire <dir> --graph-query='file(all,"(a+)+z")'          rc=134  uncaught std::regex_error (libc++)
//     ripwire <dir> --arch=rules   (deny path zz/.* -> (a+)+z)   rc=134  the same abort
//     ripwire <dir> --match='… (#match? @id "(a+)+z")'           rc=0    the throw was swallowed, the row KEPT
//
// Each copy of "compile a user's regex" had grown its own policy — screened or not, catch the compile or not,
// catch the match or not, keep or drop on a throw — and the differences were the bugs. One owner gives every
// entry point the same three verdicts: a named refusal before any engine sees the pattern, a named refusal
// when the engine gives up mid-match, or an answer.
//
// WHAT A CALL SITE GETS
//   compileGuardedRegex( pattern, syntax ) → { regex, refusal, isScreened }. `refusal` is the SAME text
//       `--regex` has always printed after "refused, nothing was scanned:" — the screen's message, or the
//       engine's own diagnostic. `isScreened` says which, for a caller whose malformed-pattern wording predates
//       the screen and is pinned (--arch). The screen runs FIRST, so its verdict is identical on every standard
//       library: a pattern one engine abandons and the other backtracks on forever gets one answer, not two.
//   GuardedRegex::search / forEachMatch → RegexVerdict { Miss, Hit, Exhausted, Skipped }. Exhausted is a
//       regex_error thrown DURING the match (libc++'s error_complexity / error_stack): the screen is a static
//       approximation, and overlapping alternation — (a|a)+z — passes it. It is never Miss. METHODOLOGY §9: an
//       abandoned match is "unknown", and a caller that folds it into "no hit" reports a zero it did not
//       measure. Every entry point refuses on it by name, quoting kRegexAbandonedReason. Skipped is a subject
//       NEVER HANDED to the engine because it exceeds this thread's measured-safe bound (maxEngineSubjectBytes)
//       — search()/search(subject,captures) take an optional stackBytes (default SIZE_MAX, i.e. unbounded, so
//       every caller that does not pass one is untouched); a caller off the grep line-loop (forEachLineMatch
//       already bounds itself) passes one explicitly. Skipped is exactly as "unknown" as Exhausted and every
//       entry point refuses on it the same way, quoting kRegexOversizeReason.
//
// THE ONE EXCEPTION BOUNDARY. std::regex reports through exceptions — regex_error from the parser and from the
// matcher, bad_alloc from either — and this codebase avoids exception handling (CONTRIBUTING §3: a recoverable
// error is a value, returned; RAII, not catch blocks, owns cleanup). So this header is the only place in src/
// that catches either, and it catches exactly those two, by type, and converts them to VALUES: a refusal
// string, or RegexVerdict::Exhausted. No catch(...) — a throw of any other type is not something a regex
// engine raises, and swallowing it would hide a bug rather than disclose a limit. Every public entry point is
// noexcept, so nothing above the seam ever sees an exception from the engine, and a call site holds no try.
// (Building a refusal string can itself allocate; under noexcept an allocation failure there terminates,
// which is the house rule that throws belong to the operator new seam alone.) Nothing here owns a resource
// a handler would have to release: the compiled regex is a value member, destroyed by its owner.
//
// COST. The screen is one linear pass over the pattern, once per compile, and a compile happens exactly where
// one happened before (once per query, per rule, per grep worker — never per file or per hit). The try around a
// match is table-based: nothing runs on the non-throwing path. The fault switch below is `constexpr false`
// under NDEBUG, so the branch and the getenv are deleted from a release build. Measured in the lane that made
// this seam: byte-identical output on every touched verb, release __text size in the CHANGELOG entry.
//
// THE ALLOWLIST, and why it is empty. src/skillscan.h was a row until its patterns moved behind this header: a skill
// file is untrusted input, so an abandoned match there must fail closed rather than abort wrap's noexcept scan.
// src/redact.h was the last row — a constant rule table — until libstdc++'s per-state recursion made it the same Linux
// crash on a long token run in a default run's emitted bodies; its rules are now matched structurally, with each
// regex kept as the specification arm (o) diffs against. A new constant table needs a reason at least that strong; a
// pattern a user can type never gets a row.

// M2 (Linux runtime probe) — the SECOND thing the two standard libraries disagree about, and the worse
// one. `--regex='(a+)+b'` over a long run of 'a' with no 'b' is the textbook catastrophic-backtracking
// shape: every way of splitting the run between the inner and the outer repetition is a distinct path,
// so a backtracking engine explores O(2^n) of them before it can report no-match.
//
// Apple libc++ has a complexity budget and gives up in well under a second with
// regex_error(error_complexity), which grepScanText's catch turned into a skipped file — the original
// A4-F10 "degrade, don't die" contract, and the only behaviour this repo had ever observed (a skipped file
// is a silent floor; GuardedRegex below now turns it into a refusal by name). libstdc++ has
// NO such budget: it never throws, so that catch is never reached and the process simply backtracks. The
// first real Linux run (Ubuntu 24.04, clang 18 + libstdc++) was still CPU-bound at 560 s on the very
// fixture the gate uses, i.e. on Linux a pathological --regex does not degrade — it hangs the tool.
//
// So the pattern is screened HERE, structurally, before either engine is handed it, for the same reason
// and in the same shape as the L5 escape screen above: the verdict must be a pure function of the pattern
// text, not of whose backtracker is linked in and not of what happens to be in the corpus. Refusal is the
// right outcome rather than a silent skip — a skipped file reads as a measurement, an exit-1 refusal that
// names the construct cannot.
//
// M2-b (Linux RE-smoke) — the first cut of this screen refused only an unbounded quantifier over a group
// that repeated WITHOUT bound inside it, and let (a?)+ and (a{1,3})+ through as "bounded inner, cannot
// blow up". That was libc++ behaviour written down as a law. On Ubuntu 24.04 / clang 18 / libstdc++ both
// of those patterns HANG — the re-smoke killed them on the harness's wall-clock cap, on the same fixture
// and in the same way as (a+)+b, and they had been shipping as this gate's "must still scan" controls.
// BOUNDED IS NOT UNAMBIGUOUS: '(a?)+' splits a run of 'a' in as many ways as '(a+)+' does, because the
// inner may also match EMPTY, and '(a{1,3})+' because the inner's width varies. So the screen is widened
// rather than the verdict split per platform.
//
// WHAT IS CAUGHT: an unbounded quantifier ('*', '+', '{n,}') applied to a group that contains ANY
// quantifier anywhere inside it, at any nesting depth — bounded ones included. (X+)+, (X*)*, (X+)*,
// (X{n,})+, ((X+))+, ((X)+)+, (X+|Y)+ as before, and now (X?)+, (X{m,n})+, ((X)?)+ and (X{n})+ too.
// Exact '{n}' is in ON PURPOSE: a fixed-count inner is only unambiguous when what it repeats is itself
// fixed-width, and '((ab|c){2})+d' is a real bomb that reading the quantifier alone cannot tell apart from
// '(a{3})+b'. A screen that must return ONE verdict on two different backtrackers cannot make that call.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT CAUGHT, so the guard does not quietly eat working patterns: a group with no
// quantifier inside passes however it is quantified, so (abc)+, (a|b)+ and (a)+b pass; a BOUNDED outer
// quantifier passes whatever the group contains, which is what keeps the workaround this very message
// suggests — '(\s*\w+){1,20}' — legal; an UNQUANTIFIED group passes whatever it contains, so (a+)b, (a?)b
// and (a+)(b)+ pass; '+' inside a character class or behind a backslash is a literal, so [a+]+ and (\+)+
// pass; and the '?' that opens '(?:', '(?=' or '(?!' is a group MODIFIER, not a quantifier, so (?:abc)+
// passes while (?:a+)+b is still refused. The known GAP is overlapping alternation — (a|a)+b is a real
// bomb whose branches only overlap semantically — which is why GuardedRegex's match-time catch below is kept
// as belt-and-braces rather than removed. Every one of these cases is an arm of test/regexbombcheck.sh.
//
// Scope: EVERY user-authored pattern, through compileGuardedRegex below — --regex, --graph-query file(), the
// --arch path-rules and the #match?/#not-match? predicates of --match and --lint-rules. This paragraph used to
// scope the screen to --regex alone, on the reasoning that --arch rules "come from a committed rules file, not
// from the command line"; that exemption is how `file(all,"(a+)+z")` and `deny path zz/.* -> (a+)+z` reached
// the engine unscreened and aborted the process (rc 134 on libc++). A rules file is user-authored text exactly

// ── THE PATTERN'S SHAPE, read once when it compiles ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// libstdc++'s matcher is a depth-first search that RECURSES once for every state it steps through, so a match that
// consumes a long run recurses once per byte or more: on Linux's 8 MiB stack `--regex='a*b'` died with SIGSEGV on a
// matching line of about 26 KB (27–45 KB across this tool's own gcc and clang builds). No pattern bound reaches
// that — the depth is set by the SUBJECT. Three facts about the pattern let a match avoid the engine or bound it:
//
//   1. THE LITERAL PLAN. A pattern that is one literal, or an alternation of literals (one literal may carry `^`
//      and `$`), matches exactly where a byte search finds it, in the engine's own order: leftmost start first,
//      and at one start the first alternative written. Nothing recurses and no line is too long for it.
//   2. THE REQUIRED LITERALS. Every match of `foo.*bar` contains "foo": a run of plain literal bytes with no
//      quantifier on any of them, outside every group, in each top-level alternative. A subject holding none of
//      an alternation's runs cannot match, so the engine is never asked. Under icase the runs are ASCII-lowered
//      and compared folded, and only while the global locale is the classic one — std::regex folds through the
//      locale the regex was built under, and the classic locale folds A–Z and nothing else.
//   3. THE RECURSION COST. An upper bound on how many states libstdc++'s matcher can have on its stack for a
//      subject of N bytes, `fixedVisits + visitsPerByte × N`, which the caller turns into the longest subject
//      its thread's stack can take (maxEngineSubjectBytes).
//
// The reader below is conservative, not a second regex parser: a token it cannot vouch for (a bracket nested in a
// class, a `{` that is not a quantifier, a bare `]` or `}`) ends the literal plan and the required run, and still
// counts as a state for the cost. test/regexguardcheck.sh arm (j) runs every fact against the engine itself.

//   * the subject position never moves backwards, and each consuming state moves it by one byte;
//   * at one position, a repeat state descends into its body at most twice (_M_rep_once_more's count is saved and
//     restored only when the frame unwinds), so a state on a cycle appears at most 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 times per position:
//     two descents, one entry by consuming the previous byte, and (for the repeat state itself) two loop-backs;
//   * a lookahead runs a separate executor nested on the same stack, which returns before the path continues.
// So for a subject of N bytes the path is at most  T + N + 5·C·(N + 1)  states, T = every state and C = the
// non-consuming states on a cycle, plus the deepest lookahead's own bound. The model below uses 6 for that 5, a
