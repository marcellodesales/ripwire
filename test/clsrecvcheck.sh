# clsrecvcheck.sh — Rule 2c, the CLASS-NAME receiver route (docs/EVALS.md "Phase 4b").
#
#   test/clsrecvcheck.sh                    # uses build/ripwire on test/clsrecvfix
#   RIPWIRE_BIN=asan/ripwire test/clsrecvcheck.sh
#
# WHY THIS GATE EXISTS. `Cls.m(...)` — a static/classmethod call THROUGH THE CLASS NAME — reaches the
# resolver as a named-receiver call whose receiver variable has no local binding, so Rule 2 (typed local)
# cannot fire and the S6-C locality tie-break hands the win to the CALLER's own class by the scope segment.
# On astropy that was 5 of the 13 sibling-class disconfirmations left after Phase 4 (`_Interval.validate(…)`
# pinned to `ModelBoundingBox::validate`; `IERS_B.open()` pinned to `IERS_Auto::open`). Rule 2c reads the
# receiver token as the type it names and resolves the callee against that class — walking its direct bases
# level by level when the class itself defines no such method — under Rule 2b's shadow veto.
#
# THE FIXTURE (test/clsrecvfix/boxes.py): one class-name call, four controls (untyped local, a shadowing
# parameter, an inherited method through the base walk, a class that defines no such method).
#
# The three controls where the route does NOT fire used to assert the S6-C locality pin STANDS (mech=locality,
# lpin="1") — that is, that the caller's own Box::validate kept winning by the scope segment. Since 2026-09-16 an
# explicit receiver whose type no receiver rule established earns no scope-segment credit (test/localitycheck.sh
# arms 5-9: that pin was the wrong answer on 14 of 14 sampled rocksdb sites), so a non-firing route leaves the
# honest two-way split instead. The contrast the controls exist for is unchanged: the route fires ⇒ receiver-rule,
# Interval::validate ALONE; it does not ⇒ both candidates survive.
#
# Arms H-N — a MEMBER FIELD named like a class (2026-09-17). Inside a C++ member function an unqualified name finds a
# member of the class or of a base before any namespace-scope class, so `Reader->read()` beside
# `std::unique_ptr<Widget> Reader;` calls Widget::read. A member is not a local, so the shadow veto never saw it and the
# route read the token as the unrelated class `Reader` in another directory: ONE precise edge to Reader::read, no amb=.
# Two llvm-project instances were graded: LVReader.cpp `OutputFile->keep()` (member `std::unique_ptr<ToolOutputFile>
# OutputFile`) landed on VirtualOutputFile.cpp OutputFile::keep, and SampleProfile.cpp `Reader->read()` (a BASE-class
# member `std::unique_ptr<SampleProfileReader> Reader`) on msgpack Reader::read. The fixture is GENERATED below: a
# smart-pointer member (H), a raw-pointer member (I) and a base's member (J), each of which Rule 2b types once the
# class-name route refuses (H needs #282's pointee capture, J the base walk — both integration/train-5), a class template
# base's member (K), a member 16 levels up, past the base walk's 16-name cap (L); two controls keep the contrast: the
# same call from a class with no such member still takes the route (M), and a Python attribute named like the class does
# not veto a Python class-name call — Python reaches an attribute only through `self.` (N).
#
# Exits non-zero on any failure.
