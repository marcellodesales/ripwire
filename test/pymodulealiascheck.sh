# pymodulealiascheck.sh — issue #287: a Python member call through a module ALIAS (`import target_mod as
# tm` then `tm.run(...)`) must bind to the ONE file the alias's module resolves to, even when the callee's
# NAME is duplicated across several other indexed files. Before this fix the edge was dropped into
# `graph_ambiguous` instead — the issue's own self-contained repro (`import target_mod as tm; tm.run({})`
# against 7 files all defining `run`) shows `count="1"` (only the qualified caller) where it should show
# `count="2"`. With a GLOBALLY UNIQUE callee name the identical alias shape already resolved (the bare-name
# ladder's own accidental uniqueness win, not real module resolution) — this gate is the K>1 case.

# run reads OLD == NEW on every arm (the true, permanent passing state; that is not a bug in the gate).
# The red-before/green-after PROOF for issue #287 is a one-time artifact, pasted in the lane report,
# captured by running this gate against origin/main BEFORE this fix's commit landed — a snapshot no
# in-tree gate can re-derive after the fact, the same reason pyimportprecisecheck.sh's own monotonic_check
# (this function's model) states a forward MONOTONICITY contract instead of a historical one.
#
# The contract going forward: whatever HEAD already binds, the binary under test must ALSO bind (a
# regression net — a future change that WEAKENS the alias narrow reds here); whatever HEAD refuses to
# bind, the binary under test must ALSO refuse (no new over-binding). Each arm is checked in whichever
# direction its own name promises, so the assertion text stays honest whether OLD's answer today is
# "bound" (the now-permanent case) or "not yet bound" (only possible re-running this exact gate against
# a pre-fix HEAD, which the report captures separately).
# The four monotonicity comparators below all read the same script-scope $OLDBIN (set by monotonic_check
# right before it calls any of them) — pulled out of monotonic_check's own body (--quality-delta flagged
# that function's verbosity once round 3's arms were added inline) rather than folded into one generic
# comparator: each name states its own OLD/NEW contract, which is the point of the whole file's assertion
# labels, and a single parameterised version would hide exactly that in a mode flag.
