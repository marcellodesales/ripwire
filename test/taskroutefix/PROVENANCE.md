# taskroutefix corpus provenance

Charter: the taskroute round's orchestrator review addendum (2026-08-13, first row).
The original 50-row corpus scored held-out 1.000 by self-quotation — its fixtures templated the
intent cards' own vocabulary — so those floors were declared NOT discharged until the corpus was
rebuilt from real agent phrasing under a contamination screen and a content-hash split seal.

## Provenance rules

- `provenance=templated` — the original 50 rows, written against the intent cards. They are the
  contaminated artifact: all pinned `split=dev`, permanently excluded from held-out floors.
- `provenance=handwritten-digD[-N]` — 47 new rows hand-written 2026-08-13 in real-agent voice,
  seeded (never copied) from the 2026-08-12 history-mine dig-D phrasing classes
  (`scratchpad/history-mine/digD_phrasings.md`, 31 classes + top-40 unmatched intent openings)
  with texture from `digB_scenarios.md` and `history-mine2/veinB_failures.md`. `-N` names the
  dig-D phrasing class where one applies (e.g. `-1` verify-a-claim, `-22` review-my-diff);
  bare `handwritten-digD` = no single class fit (e.g. off-topic negatives).
- Negative rows (`permitted=abstain`): 10 handwritten, drawn from the dig-D no-clean-home
  classes — build/run-the-suite (2), data wrangling, git-history, A-vs-B comparison,
  doc-section navigation, cross-branch archaeology, off-topic prose (2) — plus one
  review-phrased row on a CLEAN tree (line 71): applicability is rejection, so the router must
  not recommend `--situ` when there is no diff.
- Structured shapes inside prose are evidence, not contamination: closed claim expressions
  (`calls(...)` etc.), the eval fixture's symbol names (`make_repo` in `bench/taskroute_eval.py`),
  and machine-emitted trace lines may appear verbatim; every surrounding word is the author's.
- TSV discipline: literal `\n` escape for multi-line trace prompts (the evaluator un-escapes);
  no tabs inside prompts.

## Contamination screen (2b-round method)

`contamination_screen.py` (this directory) extracts lowercased word-trigrams from every
handwritten prompt (structured-shape tokens stripped first) and flags any trigram also present in
(a) the intent-card string literals of `src/taskroute.h` or (b) the `--help` blocks of the 8
recommended verbs (`--verify --connect --expand --from-trace --situ --pack-task --exemplar
--for`) read from the live binary. Exit 0 clean / 1 dirty. It also verifies the split seal below
and that templated rows stay pinned to dev.

Power check (2026-08-13): known-contaminated probes flag as expected —
"I am about to write one helper function" → `about to write`, `to write one`;
"is my diff safe to merge before i push" → `safe to merge`, `before i push`;
"map a stack trace onto the indexed symbols" → 4 help-text trigrams. The zero-flag result on the
real rows is therefore a measurement, not a dead instrument.

Result: **SCREEN CLEAN** — 0 flagged trigrams across all 47 handwritten rows
(reference corpus = 1040 trigrams). No row needed rewording after the first authored pass;
rows were written avoiding card vocabulary from the start.

## Split seal (assigned before the scoring run)

Rule: `sha256(prompt cell utf-8, exactly as stored in the TSV, escapes included)`; first digest
byte `< 0x4D` → `dev`, else `test` (~30/70 expected). Applied mechanically by
`contamination_screen.py` — no hand assignment. Outcome: 47 handwritten rows → 28 test / 19 dev.
Every intent kept at least one test row (plan-feature drew only 1 — the hash rule is the rule).
Test-split negatives: 6.

**Seal: sha256(prompts.tsv) = `a1e35088949689e6431b982b1d22a86042d1a01ef9067246f524e95d7689ba0d`**

Row counts by provenance × split: templated 50 (all dev) · handwritten 47 (28 test, 19 dev).
Handwritten by intent: verify-claim 5, connect-symbols 4, understand-symbol 5, review-diff 5
(all dirty), plan-feature 5, reuse-one-symbol 4, trace-debug 4, locate-task 5, abstain 10
(one dirty off-topic, one clean review-phrased).

## Scoring run (single run, after the seal; no tuning before or after)

2026-08-13, `python3 bench/taskroute_eval.py --bin build/ripwire --corpus
test/taskroutefix/prompts.tsv --split test`, verbatim, exit 0:

```
taskroute-eval split=test rows=28 accuracy=0.750 precision=1.000 harmful=0.000 negative_specificity=1.000 coverage=0.667
  confusion want=locate-task got=abstain n=1
  confusion want=plan-feature got=abstain n=1
  confusion want=reuse-one-symbol got=abstain n=1
  confusion want=review-diff got=abstain n=1
  confusion want=understand-symbol got=abstain n=1
  confusion want=verify-claim got=abstain n=2
```

Test-split composition (28 rows, all handwritten): verify-claim 3, connect-symbols 2,
understand-symbol 3, review-diff 3, plan-feature 1, reuse-one-symbol 3, trace-debug 2,
locate-task 4, abstain 7.

Reading, honestly: the pre-registered floors HOLD on real phrasing — precision 1.000 (≥0.90),
harmful 0.000 (≤0.02), negative specificity 1.000 (≥0.90) — because the router never made a
wrong recommendation and never recommended on a negative. What the contaminated corpus hid is
COVERAGE: 1.000 → 0.667. Every miss is an abstention on an actionable row, and every one is a
lexical-card vocabulary gap, not a structured-shape failure: prose-embedded closed claims
("now i'm checking whether calls(A, B) still holds …") do not match the whole-string claim
detector (2 of 7); "let me look at X more closely" / "read through X line by line" carry no
understand-trigger word; "is this diff actually ok to merge" misses every review phrase;
"writing a small utility" misses the helper/function cards; "find the bit of code … the bug is
somewhere in there" under-scores the locate floor. Coverage has no round-1 floor by
pre-registration; these six confusion lines are the v1.1 improvement backlog, to be addressed
only under a new sealed corpus per the same rules.

`test/taskroutecheck.sh` runs this same floor line as its final arm and is ALL PASS end-to-end
against the sealed corpus (2026-08-13, including the byte-compat --verify grammar arms).

## Post-seal classifier fix and re-score (2026-08-12, orchestrator)

After the sealed run above, the byte-compat gate arms surfaced a contract violation: the router
recommended `--verify='reaches(A, B)'` for symbol-to-symbol reaches phrasing — a form the shipped
`--verify` parser refuses. Fix: `looksLikeClosedClaim` now delegates to the real parser
(`rw::verify::parseClaim`) plus the verb's own layer validation (`query::isKnownLayerWord`), so a
parser-refused claim can never route to `--verify`. The corpus was NOT touched (same seal,
sha256 a1e35088949689e6431b982b1d22a86042d1a01ef9067246f524e95d7689ba0d); the re-score is a
new-binary run, not a re-roll: test split byte-identical to the sealed run (rows=28
accuracy=0.750 precision=1.000 harmful=0.000 negative_specificity=1.000 coverage=0.667, same six
confusion lines) — no fixture row exercised the fixed sub-shape, so the fix is covered by a new
deliberate gate arm (reaches(SYM,SYM) must abstain) rather than by corpus rows. Dev-split
reference on the same binary: rows=69 accuracy=0.913 coverage=0.893 — the dev–test gap is the
measured size of the self-quotation artifact.

## data-flow / at-line / who-writes coverage round (2026-09-02, lane/n2-d)

**Corpus state note.** The corpus has grown since the 2026-08-13 sections above without a matching
PROVENANCE.md update: it now also carries a third provenance family, `provenance=instrumented-cli`
(36 rows, split by the same hash rule), used for paraphrase rows of `exact-grep`/`edit-contract` —
intents whose routing vocabulary is itself a small closed phrase list, so a paraphrase that still
triggers the intent necessarily reuses a cue phrase from the card. `contamination_screen.py` only
screens `provenance=handwritten*` rows by construction (`row["provenance"].startswith("handwritten")`),
so `instrumented-cli` rows are exempt from the trigram screen the same structural way `templated`
rows are pinned to dev — this section documents that reasoning since the original file never did.
Row counts as of this round (before the 25 rows below): 158 total, 86 templated + 36 instrumented-cli
+ 47 handwritten-digD* (unchanged from the sealed round); split dev=81/test=52 (unchanged).

**New intents, new rows.** Three router intents shipped this round (`src/taskroute.h`): `data-flow`
(`--slice=SYM:VAR --slice-flow=back`, or bare `--slice=SYM` when no variable-slot cue names a
variable), `at-line` (`--slice=@FILE:LINE` from a literal or prose-stated file:line), and
`who-writes` (`--uses=SYM`; the `Owner.field` dotted form is deliberately NOT specially parsed —
today it resolves the owner symbol only, per the round's own scope). Because these three intents'
routing vocabulary is likewise a small closed phrase list (`"who writes"`, `"data flow"`, `"flows
into"`, …), the SAME reasoning as `instrumented-cli` above governs the 25 new rows: they are
handwritten in genuinely original sentences (none copied from the round's own briefing prompt) but
necessarily use one of the closed-vocabulary trigger phrases somewhere, the same way the existing
`exact-grep`/`edit-contract` paraphrase rows do. Provenance is recorded as `handwritten-digE` to
keep them distinct and auditable, and the split is the same content-hash rule
(`sha256(prompt)[0] < 0x4D → dev`), computed and verified per row before insertion (every row's
actual hash-rule split matches its recorded `split` column — checked mechanically, not by hand).

**Contamination screen result.** `python3 test/taskroutefix/contamination_screen.py --bin
build/ripwire` (now scanning 12 recommended-verb `--help` blocks, `--slice --slice-flow --at --uses`
added to the reference set alongside the original 8) reports exactly ONE flagged line, and it is
NOT one of this round's rows: `line 61, trigram 'i change its'` on a pre-existing
`handwritten-digD-10` row from before this round, colliding with the illustrative example `"did I
change its contract?"` quoted in a `src/taskroute.h` comment. Confirmed pre-existing by running the
same screen against `origin/main`'s prompts.tsv before any row in this round was added — identical
single flag, same line, same trigram. Out of scope for this round (not introduced by it, not one of
this round's own intents); flagged separately for follow-up. All 25 new rows individually screen
clean — diffing the screen's flagged-line output before and after this round's rows land shows zero
new flags.

**Row counts added:** 25 (14 test, 11 dev; every new row's actual placement verified against a
live binary before insertion — see the before/after routing table in `docs/EVALS.md` §4). By
intent: `data-flow` 8 (4 test, 4 dev), `at-line` 7 (4 test, 3 dev), `who-writes` 5 (3 test, 2 dev),
`abstain` (negative) 5 (3 test, 2 dev) — covering both the "wording scores but no symbol/file
resolves" shape and the "wording never scores" shape per intent.

**Seal: sha256(prompts.tsv) = `b113a217a19237a1616f81fe412b06475df848e5974214f1efc496db2519dcc0`**
(post-round; rows=158, dev=92, test=66).

## Weak-tier precision round (2026-09-10, lane/helptask-precision)

**Why the corpus grew.** The 2026-09-10 audit (F-R1-01/02) showed the weak symbol tier recommending
`--expand=<English word>` on 13 of 25 adversarial prose prompts, and the committed corpus scoring
`harmful=0.000` throughout — because **the evaluator's fixture repo had no lowercase English-word
symbols at all**. Every name in `make_repo` was camelCase or Pascal, so no row could reach the weak
tier, and the class was invisible by construction. Two things changed together, and neither is
useful without the other:

- `bench/taskroute_eval.py::make_repo` gained nine lowercase code definitions (`classify`, `report`,
  `patch`, `header`, `prefix`, `audit`, `release`, `target`, `binary`) and a `package.json` whose keys
  index as `t="sec"` symbols (`version`, `summary`, `license`, `agent`, `author`, `notes`) — the two
  halves of the collision class: an English word that IS code, and an English word that is only a
  config key. `test/taskroutecheck.sh`'s own fixture repo gained the same two halves (`patch`, plus a
  `package.json` carrying `version`/`license`/`notes`).
- **Measured control:** on the 158 pre-existing rows the extended fixture repo changed nothing —
  `split=test/dev/all` accuracy, precision, harm, specificity, coverage and every confusion line are
  byte-identical before and after the repo grew (same pre-change binary). The new symbols are reachable
  only from the new rows.

**Rows added: 31 (23 test, 8 dev).** Split by the same content-hash rule
(`sha256(prompt)[0] < 0x4D → dev`), computed mechanically per row.

- **25 negatives, `provenance=handwritten-auditR1`** — the audit's own adversarial set
  (`$S/r1/s2b_adversarial.tsv`), quoted verbatim as evidence: non-code questions whose subject word is
  also an indexed name, placed directly after a symbol-slot cue. 13 of them recommended before this
  round. They are recorded under a `handwritten*` provenance deliberately, so the trigram screen and
  the split rule both apply to them.
- **3 negatives, `provenance=instrumented-cli`** — the `t="sec"` half stated in the understand card's
  own closed vocabulary (`the implementation of version|license|author`). These are caught ONLY by the
  kind filter: their intent word is disjoint from the cue that mints the name, so the
  self-confirmation rule never sees them. Same `instrumented-cli` rationale as the 2026-09-02 section
  above (a paraphrase that still triggers a closed-phrase intent necessarily reuses a card phrase).
- **3 positives (`understand-symbol`), `provenance=instrumented-cli`** — the recall the fix must NOT
  buy its precision with: a lowercase weak name still routing to `--expand` through a cue the gate does
  not itself consume (`the implementation of prefix`, `the implementation of audit`), and the sharpest
  statement of the invariant — a how-does question that later asks for the body OF the same name, which
  routes on that second, independent cue occurrence.

**Screen result: 2 flagged lines, one pre-existing and one new, both stated rather than reworded.**
`python3 test/taskroutefix/contamination_screen.py --bin build/ripwire`:

- `line 61, 'i change its'` — the pre-existing `handwritten-digD-10` flag documented in the 2026-09-02
  section above. Unchanged, still out of scope.
- `line 176, 'the value of'` — new, on the negative row *what is the value of module thinking in org
  design?*. The trigram collides with the `kVariableSlotCues` literal `"the value of"`. It is not
  reworded, for two reasons: the row is audit evidence quoted verbatim, and card vocabulary inside a
  NEGATIVE row is adversarial pressure (a live cue phrase that must still not route), the opposite of
  the self-quotation the screen exists to catch. The screen makes no positive/negative distinction and
  was deliberately not taught one to pass this round.

`FIXTURE_SYMBOLS` in the screen was deliberately NOT extended with the new lowercase names: they are
ordinary English words, so exempting them would blank real prose out of every screened row and hide
flags the screen is there to raise.

**Scoring run, same binary, three splits** (`python3 bench/taskroute_eval.py --bin build/ripwire
--corpus test/taskroutefix/prompts.tsv --split …`), pre-change binary → post-change binary:

| split | rows | accuracy | precision | harmful | neg-specificity | coverage |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| test | 89 | 0.787 → **0.921** | 0.797 → **1.000** | 0.135 → **0.000** | 0.657 → **1.000** | 0.870 → 0.870 |
| dev | 100 | — → **0.940** | — → **1.000** | — → **0.000** | — → **1.000** | — → 0.920 |
| all | 189 | 0.847 → **0.931** | 0.879 → **1.000** | 0.085 → **0.000** | 0.733 → **1.000** | 0.899 → 0.899 |

The pre-change `split=test` run **exits 1** (precision below the 0.90 floor, harm above 0.02,
specificity below 0.90): the corpus can now fail on this class, which is the whole point of the round.
Coverage is unmoved and every confusion line is identical to the pre-round run — no actionable row lost
its route.

**Seal: sha256(prompts.tsv) = `25283f2eba85aad889fe3746308df76ed8b1244529f44986c936eb6ef60b0b53`**
(post-round; rows=189, dev=100, test=89).

## Catalog-tier round (2026-09-10, lane/helptask-precision) — the verbs and skills with no route

**The gap.** The audit measured `--help-task` at **3 recommends over 39 phrasings** of the 13 surfaces
added since 2026-08-28 (F-R1-08), and found the router able to name **8 of the 16** shipped skills
(F-R1-09) — `--help-task` and the skill catalog were two routers with two vocabularies. Three of the
unrouted surfaces are VERBS, not shaping flags: `--handoff` (which has its own shipped skill),
`--plan-lint`, and the PROSE form of `--from-trace` (`looksLikeTrace` matches a PASTED artifact, and a
sanitizer report described in words contains none of its literals).

**Ten new intents** in a `catalogTaskChoice` tier that sits LAST in `directTaskChoice`, so every older
and more specific route keeps its rows: `handoff-brief` (`--handoff`), `plan-lint` (`--plan-lint=FILE`),
`trace-prose` (`--from-trace=-`), `scan-skills`/`scan-skill` (`--scan-skills`, `--scan-skill=FILE`),
`opt-remark` (`--for=TASK`), `architecture-health` (`--deps`), `quality-check` (`--quality-delta`),
`perf-symbol` (`--around=SYM`), `graph-query` (`--graph-query=EXPR`), `maintenance-risk`
(`--hotspots`). Skills nameable: **8 → 16**, and `test/taskroutecheck.sh` now reads BOTH sides from disk
so a new skill shipping without a route fails as loudly as a route naming a skill that does not exist.

**Rows added: 36 (30 positives, 3 per intent, + 6 negatives), `provenance=instrumented-cli`**, split by
the same content-hash rule. `instrumented-cli` for the same reason the 2026-09-02 section gives: each new
intent's trigger is a small closed phrase list, so a sentence that routes necessarily reuses one of its
phrases. Every row's routing outcome was verified against a live binary before insertion (30/30 after one
correction — see below); the 6 negatives are the near misses that must NOT route (an account handed off
to support, a landing-page design that needs a check, vetting a candidate's onboarding plan, a team that
inherited a support queue, a profiler vendor selling licences, a quarterly summary handed to leadership).

**Two corrections the pre-insertion verification caught, recorded rather than smoothed over:**

- *"lint the shape of docs/design-notes.md before I circulate it"* abstained: the surface test wanted the
  words "plan"/"design doc" in the PROSE. A file that names ITSELF a plan (`PLAN_*.md`, `DESIGN_*.md`) is
  surface evidence the prose need not repeat, so the check now reads the named file's own name too.
- *"lint the plan file layout before I commit it"* routed to `quality-check`. `"before i commit"` is a
  TIMING word, not a quality word — it fits linting a plan or running a gate equally well. Re-weighted
  below the floor so it can only ever CONFIRM a quality word, never carry the route alone. The prompt
  now abstains, which is correct: it names no file, and `--plan-lint` refuses a file that is not there.

**Held-out floors, before → after** (`bench/taskroute_eval.py`, same corpus, only the binary changed —
the pre-change binary is this lane's own commit 2, built and kept for the comparison):

| split | rows | accuracy | precision | harmful | neg-specificity | coverage |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| test | 114 | 0.754 → **0.939** | 1.000 → 1.000 | 0.000 → 0.000 | 1.000 → 1.000 | 0.627 → **0.907** |
| dev | 111 | — → **0.946** | — → 1.000 | — → 0.000 | — → 1.000 | — → **0.929** |
| all | 225 | 0.809 → **0.942** | 1.000 → 1.000 | 0.000 → 0.000 | 1.000 → 1.000 | 0.730 → **0.918** |

This round's red-first proof is the GATE, not the eval: coverage has no floor by the round-1 rule, so
the eval exits 0 either way. Eleven `taskroutecheck` arms fail against the pre-change binary (every one
abstained with `score="0"`), plus the two execution arms; the skill-vocabulary arm fails against the
pre-change SOURCE, naming all eight skills no `--help-task` answer could reach.

**Regression discipline.** All 189 rows that predate this tier are BYTE-IDENTICAL on
(status, intent, resolved_symbols) between this lane's commit 2 and commit 3. Surface coverage on the
audit's own 39 phrasings: **3/39 → 9/39** — the remaining 30 are the shaping flags (`--scope`,
`--slice-depth`, `--slice-flow`, `--allow-dirty`, `--no-ignore`, `--no-post-check`), the eval-only
`--pin-census`, `--edit-check` paging, and value-carrying abstentions, all of which a one-command router
declines by design.

**Screen: unchanged at 2 flagged lines** (line 61 pre-existing, line 176 from the previous section) even
though this round added a large amount of new card vocabulary to `src/taskroute.h` — no `handwritten*`
row collides with any of it.

**Seal: sha256(prompts.tsv) = `1719aea95449e222718ec38151d2bd6998a95e1dd070038baa0b6e28fd0c9cf5`**
(post-round; rows=225, dev=111, test=114).

## 2026-09-13 — the recency window (`recency-window`)

**What the round added to the router:** one intent, for the question a reader asks as *what has this
repository been moving*. It is conjunctive in three parts — a TIME word, a MOTION word, and a word naming
the corpus (or a directory of it the task named) — and it sits BELOW every pre-existing route, so each
older and more specific reading keeps first refusal.

**Rows added: 14 (10 positives, 4 negatives), `provenance=handwritten-recency`**, split by the same
content-hash rule (no hand assignment). Handwritten rather than instrumented because the trigger is not a
closed phrase list this time: a prompt can satisfy all three conjuncts with words the cards do not spell,
and 4 of the 10 positives do. Four of the positives name a DIRECTORY the fixture holds
(`bench/taskroute_eval.py::make_repo` gained `storage/queue.cpp` for exactly that reason — two camelCase
names that appear in no prompt, so no pre-existing row's symbol resolution moves).

**The four negatives are the classes the three conjuncts exist to refuse**, one each: a time word inside a
compound NAME with no motion word; a motion word about the world rather than the checkout (a supplier's
terms); a time word with no motion word at all; and an EXPLANATORY question that satisfies all three
conjuncts and is still a question about how something works, not about history.

**Held-out floors, before → after** (`bench/taskroute_eval.py`, same binary flags, only the corpus and the
binary changed; the pre-change binary is this lane's own `origin/main` build, kept for the comparison):

| split | rows | accuracy | precision | harmful | neg-specificity | coverage |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| test | 114 → 121 | 0.939 → **0.942** | 1.000 → 1.000 | 0.000 → 0.000 | 1.000 → 1.000 | 0.907 → **0.914** |
| dev | 111 → 118 | 0.946 → **0.949** | 1.000 → 1.000 | 0.000 → 0.000 | 1.000 → 1.000 | 0.929 → **0.932** |
| all | 225 → 239 | 0.942 → **0.946** | 1.000 → 1.000 | 0.000 → 0.000 | 1.000 → 1.000 | 0.918 → **0.923** |

**Regression discipline.** The 225 rows that predate this intent are BYTE-IDENTICAL on (status, intent) —
the pre-existing set scores 0.939 / 0.946 / 0.942 on the new binary, the same three numbers and the same
confusion rows it scored on the old one. All 14 new rows are correct, so the deltas above are arithmetic
on a larger denominator, not a re-ranking.

**Screen: unchanged at 2 flagged lines** (61 and 176, both pre-existing). Two authoring rules kept it
there and are worth repeating: every new CARD phrase is at most two words, so a card can never supply a
whole trigram; and every EXAMPLE in the new source comments is written in backticks, because the screen
reads double-quoted spans in `src/taskroute.h` as cards — the first draft of one comment quoted a decoy
prompt verbatim and flagged it, which is the screen working exactly as designed.

**Seal: sha256(prompts.tsv) = `c9fc7f316db6b8c1495918b0380a31be4541f771a84b332bac03ce4e142d3b0f`**
(post-round; rows=239, dev=118, test=121).

### 2026-09-13, review round — eight more rows, and one claim withdrawn

**The claim withdrawn.** The section above reports that the 225 pre-existing rows are byte-identical on
(status, intent) across the new intent. That is true and it is nearly VACUOUS as evidence that the route is
safe: measured on the same fixture, **0 of those 225 prompts reach the recency route at all** (they fail
one of the three conjuncts before the route is consulted), so the identity was never in question. The
evidence that the route does not steal an answer is the eight rows below and the gate's own arms, not that
table. Recorded here because a number that cannot move is not a measurement.

**Rows added: 8.** Four NEGATIVES for the word-boundary class the review found: with the single-word corpus
cues matched as substrings, `here` inside where/there, `source` inside outsource, `file` inside profile
and `code` inside codec each let a sentence about the world outside the checkout recommend the churn
window at `confidence="high"`. One negative for the WORKING TREE on a dirty tree (the diff question stays
`review-diff`; the route now sits below the weighted tier, where the dirty-only review route lives, and
that is how it reads `dirty`). Three POSITIVES for vocabulary that abstained: a verb weighted below the
floor (`landed`), git's own `since <a day or a date>` window, and `what is new in DIR`.

**Two rows are `instrumented-cli`, not `handwritten`**, by the rule the 2026-09-10 section states: their
trigger is a small closed phrase list (`what is new in`, `safe to merge`), so a sentence that routes
necessarily reuses one of its phrases and the trigram screen would flag it for quoting a card it has to
quote. The other six are handwritten and screened.

**Held-out floors** (`bench/taskroute_eval.py`, 247 rows):

| split | rows | accuracy | precision | harmful | neg-specificity | coverage |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| test | 128 | **0.945** | 1.000 | 0.000 | 1.000 | 0.917 |
| dev | 119 | **0.950** | 1.000 | 0.000 | 1.000 | 0.933 |
| all | 247 | **0.947** | 1.000 | 0.000 | 1.000 | 0.925 |

The original 225 still score 0.939 / 0.946 / 0.942 on this binary — the same three numbers with the same
confusion rows.

**Screen: 1 flagged line** (176, pre-existing), DOWN from the 2 this corpus carried before the round.
**[CORRECTED 2026-09-13, see the section below: that reading does not reproduce. The screen reports 2
flagged lines at this seal, 61 and 176, and reported the same 2 before the round.]**

**Seal: sha256(prompts.tsv) = `7a732691a4040e8a0c16cb95cfd9ac90f0cccb8ea904301c2228777636d47843`** (rows=247, dev=119, test=128).

### 2026-09-13, second review round — a multi-word cue is not self-delimiting

**The defect.** The round above bounded the SINGLE-word cues and left the multi-word ones on substring
matching, on the reasoning that "a phrase carries its own boundaries". A phrase delimits its own INTERIOR
and nothing at its two ends: the first word of `how do` can finish another word and the last can begin one.
`show documentation` contains `how do`; `show issues` contains `how is`. Both sentences are questions about
this repository's history, and both hit the EXPLANATORY guard and abstained. The six explanatory cues are
word-bounded now (`kExplanatoryCues`), and the CueMatch comment no longer claims what is not true of a
phrase. Reported by CodeRabbit on #218 (review 5192045896, `src/taskroute.h:1059`).

**The reported repro did not reproduce, and the real one is narrower.** The review cited
`what changed recently in the documentation directory`, on the reading that `documentation` contains
`how do`. It does not — no cue is a substring of that word, and that prompt already routed
`recency-window` on the unfixed binary. The false positive needs the cue to span TWO words: a word ending
in `how`/`what` followed by one beginning `do`/`is`/`are`/`does`. `show issues …` and `show documentation …`
are the rows below, both verified RED (abstain, `score="0"`) against the unfixed binary.

**Rows added: 2**, both `test` by the content-hash rule (no hand assignment): one POSITIVE that must route
`recency-window` (it names `storage`, which the eval fixture holds, so the scope half is exercised — on a
build shipping the flag it is `--in=storage`; this build has no such row in its flag table and composes
none), and one NEGATIVE, `how do i see the files in storage that changed recently`, which must still
abstain: bounding the cues may not buy the positives at the price of the genuine explanatory question.

**Held-out floors** (`bench/taskroute_eval.py`, 249 rows):

| split | rows | accuracy | precision | harmful | neg-specificity | coverage |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| test | 130 | **0.946** | 1.000 | 0.000 | 1.000 | 0.918 |
| dev | 119 | **0.950** | 1.000 | 0.000 | 1.000 | 0.933 |
| all | 249 | **0.948** | 1.000 | 0.000 | 1.000 | 0.925 |

The original 225 still score 0.939 / 0.946 / 0.942 on this binary.

**Screen: 2 flagged lines** (61 `i change its`, 176 `the value of`), and this is the CORRECTION the section
above needs. Measured three ways with one binary: at `5e1ae383`, the commit before this lane, the screen
reports both; at the previous round's own seal it reports both; with the two rows below it reports both and
nothing else. The round above recorded "1 flagged line … DOWN from 2" — that reading does not reproduce at
its own seal, and no corpus row was relabelled that could have produced it. Both flags are pre-existing rows
tripping card literals older than this lane (`did I change its contract?` and the `the value of` variable
cue), neither is a row this lane wrote, and the count has been 2 throughout. A number that was never
measured is not a measurement, which is the same rule this file applied to the byte-identity claim.

**Seal: sha256(prompts.tsv) = `bb802dabd45bf228b51296cca2a0f35c54824895f429954959ef7219416d0f30`** (rows=249, dev=119, test=130).

## 2026-09-19 — the routing-noise round (`lane/route-noise`) — harness events are not tasks

**The defect.** `--help-task` has no concept of "this text is a harness event, not something the user
typed". Claude Code delivers a background-task completion (`<task-notification>…</task-notification>`)
and an injected reminder (`<system-reminder>…</system-reminder>`) to `UserPromptSubmit` through the same
channel a real prompt arrives on, and the classifier answered the report prose anyway: `symbolMention`'s
old "strong" test was ANY uppercase/underscore/colon/dollar byte anywhere in an indexed name, so a
single-word capitalized class name (`Fix`, `Report`, `Summary`, `Lane`, `Split`, `WORK`, a bare `A` or
`E` — ripwire's own fixture corpora define real symbols with exactly these names, written for unrelated
rounds) passed on a leading capital alone. A background-task report quoting ordinary prose like "Summary:
A, Fix, Report" then minted a spurious `--connect='Split,Summary,A,Fix,Report'` recommendation out of
text that never named a task at all; a system-reminder mentioning "Lane E WORK" minted
`--connect='Lane,E,WORK'`; a report quoting a sanitizer excerpt minted `--from-trace=-`.

**The fix, two layers.** (1) `hooks/ripwire-claude-route.sh` and `hooks/ripwire-codex-route.sh` skip
calling the classifier at all when the prompt starts (after whitespace) with `<task-notification>` or
`<system-reminder>` — still writing a `status="skip-system"` meter row so coverage stays measurable,
mirroring the existing notification guard in `hooks/ripwire-claude-toolroute.sh` (which already covered
`<task-notification>`/`[SYSTEM NOTIFICATION` inside a Bash command/Grep pattern/Read path — untouched by
this round; a `<system-reminder>` block does not appear in tool-call arguments by construction, so its
exposure there is a different question this round found no evidence for). (2) `src/taskroute.h` carries
the identical guard (`looksLikeSystemEvent`) for `--help-task` calls that reach the classifier directly
(a test, an MCP client, a future integration) — belt and suspenders, not a redundant pair. Independently,
`symbolMention`'s strong-mention test (`identifierMentionShape`) now requires genuine identifier SHAPE —
an interior uppercase after a lowercase (a real camel/Pascal seam), an underscore, a `::`/`.` qualifier,
or explicit backtick/`()` marking in the prompt — or, failing shape, a bare word at least 4 bytes that is
not an ordinary English word (`commentcoherence.h::isCommentStopword`, reused, plus a small
`kShapelessCollisionWords` addendum — `lane`, `report`, `split`, `summary` — for the ordinary nouns a
general function-word stoplist does not carry). A SCREAMING word or a lone capital letter never qualifies
by shape alone. This fix is independent of (1): a noise prompt with no `<task-notification>` wrapper at
all (a paraphrased report, a copy-pasted summary line) is caught by this layer even when neither hook
guard fires.

**Rows added: 5, `provenance=harness-event`.** A new provenance tag, not `handwritten*`: this is
harness-generated event text (task-id/status/summary XML, a background-task report), not authored prose,
so `contamination_screen.py`'s trigram screen does not apply to it the same structural way `templated`
and `instrumented-cli` rows are exempt — the screen only iterates rows whose `provenance` starts with
`handwritten`. Split by the same content-hash rule (`sha256(prompt)[0] < 0x4D → dev`), computed
mechanically per row (TSV discipline: literal `\n` for the multi-line notification bodies). Two rows are
the exact reproductions from the bug report (`Split-out lane: edit-hint finished…` and `…Lane E WORK`);
three more, anonymized (synthetic task ids, no private paths): a plain background-task completion with no
collision words (an always-negative control), a task-notification quoting an AddressSanitizer excerpt
(the `--from-trace=-` false-positive shape), and a system-reminder combining the agent-quote shape from
the bug report with the collision words again.

**The eval fixture had to grow to reproduce the bug at all.** `bench/taskroute_eval.py::make_repo`
(and `test/taskroutecheck.sh`'s own fixture, and `test/routehookcheck.sh`'s dedicated `NREPO`
fixture) gained the same single-word capitalized classes (`A`, `E`, `Fix`, `Report`, `Summary`, `Lane`,
`WORK`, `Split`) the bug report named — without them, the corpus rows above score `abstain` on the
UNFIXED binary too (the classifier never had anything to over-resolve), which would make the "red before,
green after" proof vacuous. Measured directly (`build/ripwire` at `57d713dd`, the commit before this lane,
with this round's extended fixture): 4 of the 5 new rows recommend on the unfixed binary
(`connect-symbols` ×3, `trace-debug` ×1); the 5th (the always-negative control) correctly abstains on
both. Fixed binary: all 5 abstain. Full-corpus diff (254 rows, base vs. branch, same fixture): exactly
these 4 rows change decision; nothing else moves.

**Screen result: 2 flagged lines** (61 `i change its`, 176 `the value of`), both pre-existing and
unrelated to this round — unchanged from the previous seal. The 5 new rows are `harness-event`
provenance and are not screened by construction (see above).

**Held-out floors** (`bench/taskroute_eval.py`, 254 rows, this round's fixed binary):

| split | rows | accuracy | precision | harmful | neg-specificity | coverage |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| test | 133 | **0.947** | 1.000 | 0.000 | 1.000 | 0.918 |
| dev | 121 | **0.950** | 1.000 | 0.000 | 1.000 | 0.933 |
| all | 254 | **0.949** | 1.000 | 0.000 | 1.000 | 0.925 |

The original 249 rows are unaffected: coverage and every confusion line are unchanged from the previous
seal's numbers on this binary (0.946/0.950/0.948 accuracy by split); the identifier-shape fix only
narrows what counts as evidence for names carrying a capital/underscore/colon/dollar, and every
pre-existing positive row in the corpus uses genuine camelCase/PascalCase shape or the cue-gated
all-lowercase weak tier, neither of which this round touched.

**Seal: sha256(prompts.tsv) = `6641fcb174e5aafc897c73f915c674fc1b53b6fd1f0af813518f629b8069c220`**
(rows=254, dev=121, test=133).

## Re-seal 2026-09-19 (train-6 fix round, CI run 35418635836) — cosmetic, no row added or removed

`ripwirepubliccheck.sh` arm 8 (no dangling reference to a culled internal-pattern `.md` name) flagged the
`harness-event` row at line 252 (and its `test/taskroutecheck.sh`/`test/routehookcheck.sh` siblings, same
fixture text duplicated three ways): the fabricated filename (an underscore-joined `NEXT_SESSION`-prefixed
stem ending `.md`) matches arm 8's internal-doc-name pattern and does not ship anywhere in this tree — a dangling reference, not a real
citation; it was never meant as one, just plausible noise text alongside the collision words (`Lane`, `E`,
`WORK`) the routing-noise round's fixture needs. Renamed to `continuation_notes.md` (no
`PLAN_|AUDIT|DESIGN_|RESEARCH_|NEXT_SESSION|KICKOFF_|HANDOFF_|IDEAS_|REPORT_|SPEC` prefix, so it cannot
retrigger arm 8) in all three sites; nothing else on the row changed. Split assignment for this row is the
stored TSV column (`dev`), not re-derived from the edited text — the content-hash split rule above governs
authoring new rows, not editing one in place — so row counts are unchanged: 254 rows, 121 dev, 133 test,
same as the previous seal. Re-ran `bench/taskroute_eval.py` (254 rows, this round's binary): identical
floors to the previous seal (test 0.947 / dev 0.950 / all 0.949 accuracy, 1.000 precision, 0.000 harmful,
1.000 negative-specificity) and the SAME full-corpus decision diff as before this edit (only the 4 rows the
identifier-shape fix changes; this round's filename edit changes none) — `test/taskroutecheck.sh` and
`test/routehookcheck.sh` both ALL PASS unpiped against the rebuilt binary.

**Seal: sha256(prompts.tsv) = `69baa9d6bb038d2a1669a0f57f213d103145ff6a8873301d7b1e7445e2eabc18`**
(rows=254, dev=121, test=133).
