# withprofilecheck.sh — gate for --with-profile=FILE, the --lint × #PROF_TSV heat join (the SYZYGY
# advice-mode pairing: static finding shape × measured PMU weight). Asserts, on test/cachefix/ with a
# hand-written #PROF_TSV fixture:
#   1. determinism — the joined run twice is byte-identical
#   2. JOIN — the pointer-chase finding at unfriendly.cpp:38 (inside pointerChase, which opens at L31)
#      gains heat_* from the site at L33, with the fixture's exact values; the root carries heat_joined="1"
#   3. FENCE — a site OUTSIDE every finding's enclosing symbol (file head, L5) annotates NOTHING
#   4. heat_joined="0" is honest, not an error (sites only in friendly.cpp → 0 joins, exit 0)
#   5. refusals: --with-profile alone (no --lint) exits 1; a missing file exits 1; a file with no
#      #PROF_TSV sentinel pair exits 1 — "joined nothing" and "read the wrong file" never look alike
#   6. the heat legend appears ONLY when the flag is armed; bare --lint output carries no heat_*
#   7. xmllint-clean
#   8. a line column past INT_MAX joins nothing (std::atoi kept its low 32 bits and joined it); control at line 33
# Does NOT edit test/regression.sh (the orchestrator wires it).
