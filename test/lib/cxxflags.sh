# cxxflags.sh — the ONE parse of a CMake-generated flags.make into bash arrays. SOURCED, not run.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS — CWE-78, command injection on the CI runner.
#
# Six gates (extentcheck, jsonwalkcheck, decltodefcheck, includeprecisecheck, macroreparsecheck and
# rustimportprecisecheck) compile a unit driver against the exact flags CMake produced for $BIN, because the
# flags are front-end specific and guessing `c++` breaks a clang-configured Release tree. Each of them spelled
# the parse of those flags the same way, eighteen sites in all:
#
#     eval "CXX_FLAGS=( $( grep -m1 '^CXX_FLAGS =' "$FLAGS_MK" | sed 's/^CXX_FLAGS =//' ) )"
#
# flags.make is GENERATED, and it is reachable from a pull request. CI runs test/pargates.py on PRs and passes
# the binary under test through RIPWIRE_BIN; every one of those gates derives BUILD_DIR from that binary and
# FLAGS_MK from BUILD_DIR. Anything a PR can put into a CMake flag — a compile definition, an include
# directory, an append to CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS — lands on one of these three lines and is then handed to `eval`,
# which is a request to run it. Fork-PR workflow runs are approved by hand during a release, so the trigger is
# a maintainer who believes they are approving a test change.
#
# WHICH SHAPES ARE ACTUALLY VECTORS — measured, not assumed. Arm (P) of cxxflags_selfproof re-derives every
# line of this table on every run, each shape with its own key and its own control:
#
#     -DA="$( … )"          EXECUTES                 command substitution
#     -DB="` … `"           EXECUTES                 backticks
#     <( … )                EXECUTES, ASYNCHRONOUSLY process substitution — the sentinel can land AFTER the
#                                                    eval has returned, so a same-instant test reads it as
#                                                    "not a vector". It is one. Arm (P3) settles for it.
#     x ) ; … ; ZZ=(        EXECUTES                 close the array, run a statement, reopen a valid empty
#                                                    one. `… ; (` alone is a syntax error; `… ; ZZ=(` is not.
#     bare ;  &&  |  >      does NOT execute         each is a bash SYNTAX ERROR inside an array assignment,
#                                                    so the eval aborts having run nothing at all
#
# That last row is why every shape above gets its OWN key and its OWN control, and it is the trap this file
# exists to keep out of the next gate. A syntax-error shape and a working shape on the SAME flags line MASK
# each other: bash parses the whole assignment before running any of it, so the parse dies before it ever
# reaches the payload, nothing executes, and a single-line multi-shape arm reports "no execution" for a
# spelling that is wide open. Measured, and held by arm (P6): `-DA="$( touch S1 )" ; touch S2` fires NOTHING
# and exits 1, while `-DA="$( touch S1 )"` alone fires S1 and exits 0. A proof built on the first line would
# have certified the vulnerability as absent.
#
# THE FIX. cxxflags_words parses one flags.make line with Python's shlex.split — POSIX word splitting that
# honours quotes and backslashes and executes nothing — and emits the words NUL-terminated. cxxflags_load
# reads them back into CXX_FLAGS / CXX_DEFINES / CXX_INCLUDES, the three arrays every caller already used.
# Arm (S) holds it to byte-for-byte agreement with the old eval on a benign synthetic flags.make, including
# the make-escaped `-DX=\"str\"` defines and quoted spaced includes that a naive split mangles.
#
# Three spellings were rejected. Each is a regression if it comes back, and each has an arm:
#   * `read -ra` splits on IFS and destroys the quoting that carries the argument boundary. Real CXX_INCLUDES
#     hold `-I"/path with spaces/inc"`; read -ra turns that one argument into two and the driver stops
#     compiling. Arm (Q) measures it rather than asserting it — 4 words correct, 6 from read -ra.
#   * `mapfile -d ''` is the natural reader for NUL-terminated words and does not exist here: macOS ships
#     bash 3.2, whose mapfile has no -d. `while IFS= read -r -d ''` is the portable form.
#   * a PIPE into that loop runs the loop in a subshell, so the arrays populate and then vanish. Arm (R)
#     catches a pipe: all three arrays come back empty.
#   * a PROCESS SUBSTITUTION keeps the loop in the caller's shell and was the first spelling here, but it
#     discards the parser's exit status by construction — see _cxxflags_slurp, which reads through a scratch
#     file for exactly that reason, and arm (U), which holds the rc-4 path open. This was a real bug in this
#     file's first version: an unbalanced quote parsed to zero words and the loader returned success.
#
# THE COMPILER NAME, judged and deliberately LEFT ALONE. Every caller also takes the compiler itself from a
# generated file, one line above the parse this file replaced:
#
#     CXX="$( awk 'NR==1{ print $1; exit }' "$LINK_TXT" )"
#     [ -n "$CXX" ] && command -v "$CXX" >/dev/null 2>&1 || CXX="$( command -v c++ || command -v clang++ )"
#
# It reads like the same defect and is not. Assigning the output of a command substitution does not
# interpret that output, `command -v "$CXX"` is quoted, and `"$CXX" …` expands to exactly one word, so
# nothing in link.txt is ever parsed as shell syntax: there is no injection here, only the execution of a
# program the file names. And that capability is not new — CI ran that same compiler to build the binary the
# gate is handed, so a link.txt naming a hostile compiler means the build already executed it. Hardening the
# line would move no boundary while risking the clang/gcc mismatch the comment above it exists to prevent.
# The eval was different in kind: it turned DATA into CODE, which the build never did.
#
# One real defect was found in that line and is also left alone, on purpose: `print $1` takes the first
# whitespace-delimited token, so a compiler path containing a space (`/Applications/Xcode 16.app/…`) is
# truncated. The `command -v` guard then falls back to `c++`, which is the documented mismatch failure — a
# correctness bug, not a security one, and not this change's to fix while five gates sit on the release path.
#
# Usage (inside a gate, after its own FLAGS_MK presence check):
#     . "$ROOT/test/lib/cxxflags.sh"
#     cxxflags_load "$FLAGS_MK" || { no "..."; }      # populates CXX_FLAGS, CXX_DEFINES, CXX_INCLUDES
#
# This file sets no traps (gates own their EXIT trap), defines no reporting helper, and writes only inside a
# directory the caller hands it. cxxflags_selfproof prints PASS/FAIL/NOTE rows on stdout and never calls the
# caller's ok/no, so each gate maps the rows onto its own reporters and stays independent of the others.

# THE READ GOES THROUGH A FILE, and that is the whole point of this function. The obvious spelling is a

#
#     while IFS= read -r -d '' _w; do A+=( "$_w" ); done < <( cxxflags_words "$_mk" "$_key" )
#
# and it CANNOT report that the parser failed. A process substitution's exit status never reaches `$?` — after
# the loop `$?` belongs to `read` (1 at EOF), the redirection's status is discarded, and `< <(…)` sets no `$!`
# on bash 3.2, so there is nothing to `wait` on either. The failure that matters is rc 4, an unbalanced quote
# in the generated file: the parser writes its stderr line, exits 4, and emits ZERO words — so the loop reads
# nothing, the array comes back empty, and the loader returns 0. A gate would then compile against an empty
# flag set and report a result. That is a check succeeding over a population it never examined, which is the
# same defect class as the eval this file removes, so it gets the same treatment rather than a comment.
#
# A plain redirection to a scratch file makes `$?` the producer's real status. Command substitution is not an
# option: a shell variable cannot hold a NUL, and NUL is what keeps the argument boundaries.

# One row, one return code. Callers pass the words with the `${A[@]+"${A[@]}"}` guard, because bash 3.2 under
# `set -u` treats "${EMPTY[@]}" as an unbound variable and would abort the calling gate instead of failing an
# arm; "$@" over no arguments is the one expansion that is always safe.
#
# An ERE and not a `case` glob, for a reason this arm caught in its own first draft: `|` inside a glob held in
# a VARIABLE is a literal bar, not an alternation — only a `|` written literally in the case statement
# separates patterns. So `case "$w" in $_glob)` with _glob='-I*|-isystem|/*' matched nothing and reported
# every real include as split. The bug was visible only because the arm runs against a real flags.make.
