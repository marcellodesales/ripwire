# skillscanreadcheck.sh — gate for §P0.5a: an unreadable/nonexistent --scan-skill(s) path must never read as "safe".
#
# THE BUG: `--scan-skill=/nonexistent/path` printed "0 finding(s)" on stderr, nothing on stdout, and
# exited 0 — byte-identical (on every channel that matters to a caller checking $?  or grepping stdout)
# to a genuinely CLEAN scan of a real, readable, harmless skill file. --scan-skill is the verb a user
# runs to vet an UNTRUSTED skill file *before* installing it; a typo'd path silently reads as "safe".
# The dir form --scan-skills=DIR on a nonexistent/unreadable explicit dir has the same defect.
#
# THE FIX (verified against the implementation, not just described): an unreadable/nonexistent path
# must refuse — stderr names the path, stdout carries no clean-scan output, exit is non-zero and NOT
# one of the verb's own verdict codes (0=clean/1=WARN/2=CRITICAL, per --help). A real clean file must
# still exit 0, and an empty-but-readable file is a legitimate clean scan (exit 0), not a refusal.

#   bash test/skillscanreadcheck.sh

# ══ §B13.3 — the DIRECTORY form's population must be its whole subject ═════════════════════════════

# did not: this repo's skills/ holds 24 files and the two it never opened are skills/install.sh and

# two entry points disagreed about their own subject. This section pins the agreement, and pins that the

# Under libstdc++ the engine's safe subject is bounded by the thread's stack (src/regexguard.h maxEngineSubjectBytes). The
# scan used to run on the caller's 512 KiB planning floor, a bound of 0: every skill failed CLOSED on Linux while macOS
# (libc++, no bound) passed. It now runs on a 256 MiB thread, and the cross-line INJECTION pass searches 1 KiB windows of
# the joined body instead of the whole of it. No fault switch: these must hold on the plain and the Release flavour alike.
