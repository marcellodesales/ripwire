# qbaselineproducercheck.sh — a .ripwire_quality_baseline sidecar is a floor only for the build that pinned it.
#
# THE BUG THIS PINS. `--quality-baseline` writes a sidecar holding `dead <key>` records, and a dead set is a
# function of CALL RESOLUTION (quality.h isDeadCandidate reads g.inEdges). The sidecar stamped only `head <sha>`,
# and --quality-delta's one staleness test (selectBaseline) compared only that. So at the SAME HEAD a floor pinned
# by one build was compared against another build's working-tree dead set — the qsnap cache defect
# (test/qsnapproducercheck.sh) in the file a user writes on purpose. The window is ordinary: pin with the PATH
# binary, then run the delta with ./build/ripwire, or after an upgrade, before the next commit.
#
# MEASURED before the fix, two real builds of d8c225a2 — as built, and with graph.h's keepStdQualifiedCandidates
# forced to `return true` (the std::-qualified call guard off) — over this gate's fixture, where
# `std::launder( &v )` binds the in-repo Pool::launder only without the guard:
#   PHANTOM, working tree untouched but for a comment:
#     pin guarded,   delta guarded     baseline="sidecar" gating="0", exit 0
#     pin unguarded, delta guarded     baseline="sidecar" gating="1", exit 2 — a dead-code row on Pool::launder
#   HIDDEN, working tree drops the std::launder call (Pool::launder really loses its only caller):
#     pin unguarded, delta unguarded   baseline="sidecar" gating="1", exit 2 — the real regression
#     pin guarded,   delta unguarded   baseline="sidecar" gating="0", exit 0 — the regression is hidden
#
# THE FIX. The sidecar format is v6: it carries `producer <64 hex>`, the build's producer identity
# (cmake/source_identity.cmake — SHA-256 over src/ and queries/). A sidecar pinned at the current HEAD whose
# producer is absent or differs is FOREIGN: never honored, never deleted (the build that pinned it may run
# again), and the delta falls back to the git-HEAD tree THIS build computes, disclosed as
# baseline="git-HEAD (foreign sidecar ignored)". A root with no git HEAD has nothing to fall back to and exits
# 1 naming the foreign pin. A v5 sidecar can only come from a build without the stamp, so the version rule
# refuses it — and that refusal now lands on the marker that says a sidecar is there.
#
# Checks (a forged pair differs in exactly ONE thing, and the mutation is asserted to have taken):
#   (A) FORMAT — the binary's own pin is v6 and carries exactly one producer record, equal to this tree's
#       identity: $BIN was built from these sources and says so.
#   (B) HONORED — this build's own pin is the floor (baseline="sidecar", exit 0) and is left byte-identical.
#   (C) PHANTOM — the pin with its dead records dropped (a resolver that saw a caller for Pool::launder):
#         C1 producer kept    -> served: a gating dead-code row the no-sidecar run lacks (the control)
#         C2 producer flipped -> ignored: rows and exit equal the no-sidecar run, the marker says why, the
#                                file stays on disk byte-identical, stderr names the foreign pin
#   (D) HIDDEN — the working tree deletes useIt's only call; the pin gains useIt's dead key, read from a real
#       pin at a scratch commit where useIt is dead (a resolver that never saw the call):
#         D1 producer kept    -> served: the real regression disappears (the control)
#         D2 producer flipped -> ignored: the regression is reported, exit equal to the no-sidecar run
#   (E) UNSTAMPED — a v6 pin with its producer record deleted is not honored: nothing says which build wrote it.
#   (F) PRE-STAMP — the v5 shape (older header, no producer) is refused by the version rule and reported as
#       baseline="git-HEAD (sidecar unreadable)", never as "no sidecar": the file is right there.
#   (G) STALE WINS — a pin that is BOTH at another sha and from another build keeps the stale self-heal.
#   (H) NO GIT — this build's pin is honored in a non-git root; a foreign one exits 1 naming it, never "no <file>",
#       and is left on disk; a v5 one exits 1 naming the refusal, never "no <file>".
#   (I) MCP — the read-only quality_delta verb answers the D pair the same way (served / ignored, file kept).
#   (J) DISCLOSURE — the full legend defines the foreign marker; --help names it.
