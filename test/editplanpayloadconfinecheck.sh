# editplanpayloadconfinecheck.sh — A5: an edit plan may only read payloads that sit beside it, and the
# dry-run receipt shows which bytes each operation will read. Plus A7: a QUOTED version is not numeric 1.
#
# THE BUG THIS GATE PINS (A5). editplan::siblingPath returned the payload verbatim when it was absolute, and
# otherwise joined it to the plan's directory with no normalization. So a plan could say
#
#   {"op":"replace_symbol_body","target":"alpha","payload":"../../../../etc/hosts"}
#
# and that file's bytes were spliced into a source file, reported as an ordinary success. This is a READ
# escape only — no write ever lands outside the crawl root, which is why it is LOW and not a write hole —
# but a plan arriving from a shared repo, a PR, or another agent could quietly bake a secret into a file the
# next commit publishes. And the --dry-run receipt, the thing a human reads BEFORE --apply, named the op,
# the target and the file, but never the payload, so the review could not have caught it either.
#
# ARMS:
#   1. a "../" escape refuses, and the message names the path it actually RESOLVED (not the spelling the
#      plan wrote, which is the whole point — the spelling is what disguised it).
#   2. an ABSOLUTE payload path refuses.
#   3. a SYMLINK sitting inside the plan directory but pointing out of it refuses — the case a purely
#      lexical check would wave through.
#   4. a NON-EXISTENT escape refuses as an escape, not as a mere read failure — the case realpath cannot
#      judge, so a purely realpath-based check would mis-report it.
#   5. an ordinary payload beside the plan still works, under BOTH a relative and an absolute plan path
#      (the symlinked-prefix false positive: /tmp vs /private/tmp must not read as an escape).
#   6. the dry-run receipt carries payload_path for every operation.
#   7. every refusal leaves the corpus byte-identical, and no secret byte reaches it.
#   8. (A7) {"version":"1"} — the JSON string — is refused, as the spec and the refusal text both say
#      NUMERIC 1. findRawValue strips quotes, so `1` and `"1"` both arrived as text=="1" and the string
#      form slipped through a rule the message claimed to enforce.
#   9. a directory symlink inside the plan dir plus a `..` payload that resolves out of the plan dir refuses,
#      naming the resolved path, with nothing from outside reaching the corpus; an in-root dir symlink + `..`
#      control is still accepted.
#  10. PROBE: a program compiled against src/pathguard.h alone drives rw::pathguard::readWholeBeneathNoFollow —
#      the read parseEdit uses — directly. Anchored at a directory, it reads a regular file beneath it, and
#      refuses a path whose intermediate component beneath the anchor is a symlink (even to a real directory),
#      a final symlink, a `..` component, a path outside the anchor and a FIFO (without blocking). A contrast
#      plain open of the same intermediate-symlink path DOES read the outside file, so the refusal rows can fail.
#      A source row pins that parseEdit reads through it, anchored at the plan's own directory.
