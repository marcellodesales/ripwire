# testrowruncheck.sh — the FAMILY gate for "a tests_to_run row says how to run it".
#
# capture-audit 2026-09-04, finding M21(b) (lens 0 M0-3, lens 2 L2, lens 8 §(2)).
#
# THE DEFECT. Seven verbs answer "which tests must I run" and they did not agree on whether the answer is a
# COMMAND or a PATH. --test-gate — the verb that EXITS 4 calling its rows "the obligations" — printed
# `<t p="./test/verify_radix.cpp"/>`: the agent is told a test must run and not how. --handoff printed the
# same rows with no run= at all while --situ/--pr-context/--affected beside it carried
# `run="bash test/…check.sh"` for the same file. testmap.h's rule was "absent run= means NOT DERIVABLE", and
# that rule is right — a guessed command is worse than none — but an ABSENCE is not a disclosure: a reader
# cannot tell "no runner exists for this harness" from "this emitter forgot to ask". The honesty contract
# (a zero means none FOUND, every gap stated where it is consumed) wants the not-derivable case SAID.
#
# THE PROPERTY, asserted over the family and not over one verb: every tests_to_run row, in every dialect,
# carries EITHER a real `run=` / `"run":` / `(run: …)` recipe OR the explicit `run_unknown="1"` /
# `"run_unknown":true` / `(run: not derivable)` disclosure — never neither. Plus M21(b)'s second half: the
# untested blast-radius `<u>` rows carry `l=`, the line their sibling --flags --flip rows have always had.
#
# E1 / A4-2 (2026-09-12, owner call): runner-less rows that share their per-row attributes are served as ONE
# `<g … n= p="a,b,c" run_unknown="1"/>` row (JSON `{"p":[…],…,"n":N,"run_unknown":true}`, text
# `[hops=N] (n): a, b, c   (run: not derivable)`), so the disclosure is said once per GROUP. The rule keeps
# its meaning — "a <t> or <g> row carries one or the other, never neither" — and arm 12 proves what the
# grouping must never change: the MULTISET of paths (every path verbatim, each exactly once, across every
# dialect), on a fixture with three hop groups and a runner row in the middle of one of them.
#
# ARM 0 is the DERIVATION arm: it enumerates the row emitters out of src/ and fails when a site appears that
# the arms below do not drive. That is what makes this a family gate rather than seven instance gates — a
# NEW verb that grows a tests_to_run row is a FAILURE here until it is driven and disclosed. Since E1 every
# emitter renders its rows through testmap.h's ONE seam (testRowsRendered), so the census is its call sites.

# ── ARM 16 — THE SHARED READER'S OWN TWO SILENCES (CodeRabbit on #214) ────────────────────────────────
# test/testrowpaths.py exists because eight private readers went quiet instead of failing. Two of its own
# did the same, and neither had a control until now.
#
# (a) A TRUNCATED JSON document. json_list_slice returned None both when the field is ABSENT and when its
#     array never closes, and json_paths turned None into [] with exit 0 — so a document cut mid-array
#     asserted over zero rows and PASSED. The two are different claims and now answer differently: no field
#     is an answer (0 paths, exit 0); a field whose list never closes is exit 2 with a named reason.
# (b) A PATH WITH A SPACE in the text dialect. The single-row reader took `(\S+)`, which stops at the first
#     space, so such a path was reported TRUNCATED — a path that does not exist, produced silently. The
#     reader now cuts the run suffix and the renderer's own attribute tail ([changed] [partner] [hops=N], in
#     that order) and keeps everything else verbatim.
#
# Both arms are RED on the reader as it stood at 6621370f (a: 0 paths, rc=0; b: "test/with" for

# found the NEXT '[' anywhere in the document, and sliced THAT. Measured on the reader as it stood at
# c9d6d4e8: `{"tests_to_run":null,"other":[{"p":"ghost.cpp"}]}` returned ghost.cpp at rc=0 — a foreign
# field's paths served as the tests_to_run answer, which is the same species of defect arm 16 closed and one
