# narrowcheck.sh — gate for P2-D Rule 2 receiver-VARIABLE type narrowing (ABS-1 / locals-style scoping).
#
# The narrow: `Foo x; x.run()` and `auto y = Bar(); y.run()` resolve run to Foo::run / Bar::run ONLY
# (the var's type is known), instead of the bare §2a ladder's WRONG 1/k split across every same-named
# `run`. The soundness discipline (resolve.h::rule2RecvVarType) is "a wrong narrow is worse than no
# narrow": it fires ONLY when the var has a known, non-tombstoned type binding whose class actually
# DEFINES the called method (canonByName hit) — otherwise it degrades to §2a unchanged.
#
# The fixture pairs each narrowed caller with a NEGATIVE CONTROL of the SAME call shape whose receiver
# is a local the capture cannot type (`auto p = pool[ slot ]; p->run()`) — no var→type binding, so Rule 2
# can't fire and the call stays HONESTLY AMBIGUOUS. The narrowed-vs-control contrast is the proof the narrow
# is REAL (a binding-driven resolution, not a vacuously-unambiguous fixture). The control used to be a
# function PARAMETER; arms 7-18 are why it is not any more.
#
# Arms 7-16 — PARAMETER receivers (2026-09-16). A parameter's written type (LocalBindKind::ParamType) was
# captured but read only by the field use-site index, so `int Decoy::plainCaller( Target& other ) { return
# other.pick( 1 ); }` fell through Rule 2 to the S6-C locality tie-break, which hands the tie to the CALLER'S
# OWN class: one precise edge to Decoy::pick, no amb=, nothing disclosed. Rule 2 now reads ParamType records
# LEXICALLY — the innermost declaration of the name whose scope covers the call site decides, and only a
# declaration with a written type narrows. The fixture is GENERATED (line numbers are load-bearing: p= tells
# Target's methods, line 1, from Other's, line 2, and Decoy's, lines 5-6). Two kinds of arm:
#   * RED on the unfixed binary: the parameter/range-for/lambda receivers that must now pin to Target.
#   * RED on a NAIVE fix that folds ParamType into Rule 2's flat per-function table (observed, see the
#     commit): a range-for variable's type leaking to a later `auto` loop of the same name (12), to a
#     same-named FIELD read outside the loop (13), and an untyped nested redeclaration of a parameter (14);
#     plus (10), where the flat table's tombstone would throw away two precise answers.
#   * Arms 17-24 — a written type is recorded as its final segment and class names carry no namespace, so a type
#     written in namespace `std` (`std::map<int, int>`) matched an unrelated in-repo class `map`. `std` is reserved
#     to the implementation — a program declares no class in it — so a `std::`-led written type never narrows, for
#     a parameter (17), a typed local (19), a constructor-inferred local (20) and a C++ assignment (21). Every other
#     qualifier keeps its narrow: an in-repo namespace is the common case (22, 23). (24) pins the stated floor.
#   * Arm 25 — DISCLOSURE: a narrow decided by a qualified written type matched only its final segment, so it never reads
#     as precise. Its edge carries prov="final-segment" (the floor's wrong edge, a correct parameter narrow and the local
#     twin alike); an unqualified narrow and a uniquely named call carry no prov=, and both legends define the value.
#   * Arms 39-43 — TEMPLATE ARGUMENTS in a written type (2026-09-17). An unqualified template-id (`Vec<Decl *>& v`) recorded
#     no type at all, so `v.size()` never reached Rule 2, while its qualified twin (`ll::Vec<Decl *>&`) did; and a type
#     whose arguments sit before its last name (`Outer<int>::Inner& in`) recorded `Outer` — a precise edge to the wrong
#     class wherever `Outer` defines the method. The recorded name is now the type's LAST NAME read through the grammar's
#     fields, never cut from its text.
#     (39d) pins the stated floor: an unqualified template-id CONSTRUCTOR (`auto v = Vec<Decl *>()`) infers nothing.
#   * Arms 44-51 — an ASSIGNMENT's callee is a type only when a class is called that (2026-09-17). `t = ns::cast<Target>( y )`
#     recorded `cast`, and the conflict tombstoned the written `Target* t`: Rule 2's narrow (44, 45, 50), the field use-site
#     pin (49) and a member's Rule 2b narrow (46) were lost. A class-named assignment still types and still conflicts (47);
#     a DECLARATION initialised by a call still tombstones a sibling declaration (48); the new record byte round-trips
#     the cache (51).
#   * Arms 52-60 — a direct-initialized local whose every argument is a plain name (`IRBuilder<> Builder(Rem);`) parses as a
#     local FUNCTION declaration. The tags query minted a function symbol for it, the local's type binding was attributed
#     to that symbol instead of to the enclosing function, and Rule 2 never saw the type. RED on the unfixed binary:
#     52-58. RED on a naive fix that refuses every body-local declarator: 59. 60 pins the multiplication floor.

# ── Arms 17-24: a written type is only its FINAL segment (`std::map<int, int>` records `map`), and class names carry no

#    its name — measured on a private C++ corpus as precise wrong edges from `const std::map<K, V>& ref; ref.lower_bound()`
#    and six `std::map<…> m; m.find()` LOCALS to an in-repo `map`. `std` is reserved to the implementation
#    ([namespace.std]: a program adds no declaration to it but a specialization), so no in-repo class IS `std::map`, and
#    a `std::`-led written type never narrows (the qualified text rides the record: kParserVer 97, and 98 for the

# ── Arms 26-31: CLASS IDENTITY — an interface-typed receiver and its NESTED NAMESAKES (2026-09-16). Rule 2 matched
#    `T::m` by the final class-name segment, and a nested class loses its enclosing class in that key: a call through
#    `Iterator* it` whose Iterator is an abstract interface (its methods are pure-virtual DECLARATIONS, never in the
#    definitions-only map) narrowed onto the unrelated nested `Iterator` classes that do define the method, and every
#    candidate was wrong (measured on rocksdb @ 0e2801ac3: 79 sites, 5-way splits over memtable/'s nested iterators).
#    Now: a hit owned by a nested class the caller cannot name is dropped, and when nothing is left and the method is
#    only DECLARED along the receiver class's ancestry, the call resolves to the definitions in the class's real
#    subclasses — an honest dispatch split, never trimmed to the same-file override by the locality ladder. LINE

# ── Arms 44-51: a type read off an ASSIGNMENT's callee (2026-09-17). C++ `x = f( … )` records the callee's last name as
#    x's type, because a constructor call and a function call are one grammar node — `t = ns::cast<Target>( y )` recorded
#    `cast`, `t = makeTarget( y )` recorded `makeTarget`. Rule 2's flat per-function table tombstones a variable whose
#    records disagree, so the non-type erased the variable's WRITTEN type (`Target* t = nullptr;`) and the call declined
#    (a same-named method sits two directories away); the field use-site index lost the same pin, and the record made a
#    MEMBER assigned from a call read as a local, so Rule 2b refused its declared type. An assignment declares nothing, so
#    its callee is a type only when the corpus defines a class of that name. Candidates live two directories apart from the
#    caller and nothing is included, so an unnarrowed call declines (no edge) instead of landing on a same-directory guess.

# ── Arms 52-60 (2026-09-17): a DIRECT-INITIALIZED local whose every argument is a plain name — `IRBuilder<> Builder(Rem);`,
#    `std::lock_guard<std::mutex> Lock(Mtx);`, `Slice end(end_str);` — is the most-vexing-parse shape. The grammar cannot
#    tell a name from a type, so it reads the statement as a local FUNCTION declaration, and the tags query minted a
#    function symbol `Builder` whose span is the declaration. The local's type binding was attributed to that symbol (the
#    innermost span covering the declaration byte), not to the function the local lives in, so Rule 2 looked up
#    `<enclosing fn>#Builder`, found nothing, and `Builder.CreateSExt()` fell to the name ladder. A body-local declarator
#    now mints no symbol unless something in it can only be written in a prototype. Candidates live two directories away
#    from the caller, and nothing is #included, so a site no rule decides DECLINES (no edge) instead of reaching Rule 3.
